20:29:33 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:

20:37:35 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	The example word here is so *deeply* British
20:37:48 From  Obaid  to  Everyone:
	xd
20:39:17 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	😲 We’ve used Merkle trees to let folks claim $SPORK after contributing to ETHDenver!
20:40:31 From  Marian Jiménez-P  to  Everyone:
	The Hash (ABCE) keep all those transactions just as blocks of blockchain keeps X quantity of transactions?
20:41:19 From  Anthony Colas | ToDestiny.eth#7351  to  Everyone:
	It doesnt change anything, just to see if the data have been tempered with. For example if you changed some transactions in your favor ;) Therefore its secure.
20:42:21 From  Marian Jiménez-P  to  Everyone:
	But were we talking about blocks of blockchain, there? Or it is another system for Smart contracts?
20:42:38 From  Grégoire Motot  to  Everyone:
	Do you have other real use case examples for Merkle tree?
20:42:53 From  Ihab | Hebx  to  Everyone:
	What will happen to Blockchain and Classic Cryptography when Quantum Key Distribution will be used in the IT Industry in the near future?
20:43:19 From  robodehri#9894  to  Everyone:
	We will switch to post quantum secure algorithms
20:43:23 From  Anthony Colas | ToDestiny.eth#7351  to  Everyone:
	Yes. You get all the data. SHA256 to get a result etc etc. Nothing to do with smart contracts or the blobkchain. Just a way to see if you changed some data in large files/data.
20:43:31 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	@marian a single hash or a whole Merkle tree can be generated “off-chain”, then the result (the output) can be stored on-chain
20:44:33 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	GNutella seems so sweeeeeeetttt😋
20:44:41 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	In my $SPORK claim example, we created a Merkle tree for all of the public wallet addresses of folks that contributed to ETHDenver. Then we stored the output of that process (the Merkle root) on-chain so that the smart contract could easily verify whether a given address was in the tree (i.e. whether they should be able to claim)
20:45:36 From  JanarDot#1311  to  Everyone:
	lol there is a photo
20:45:41 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:

20:45:49 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	🤣
20:45:49 From  Shubhank Saxena  to  Everyone:
	Hal Finny
20:45:58 From  Chris Kagabe  to  Everyone:
	Yeah probably hal finney
20:45:59 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	who came up with this one though?
20:46:04 From  Kemal Ardıl Gülez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	some people theoretize that he’s Nick Szabo
20:46:08 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	that dude is A Satoshi Nakamoto, but not THE 😂
20:46:34 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:
	So Derrek, the advantage there is that its hash’d so everyone doesn't see the list of all eligible addresses?
20:46:42 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	that guy lived on the same street as hal finney too…. 🤔
20:47:01 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	^ Exactly, icculus! And a second benefit is it’s much more gas-efficient to verify that way
20:47:07 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	oh man that famous pizza…
20:47:14 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:
	Cool, thanks Derrek
20:47:24 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	that expensive one, nowdays
20:47:25 From  CryptoMartian #2869  to  Everyone:
	NIck Szabo can also be a good guess here. he developed first decentralized currency Bit gold in 2008.
20:47:54 From  Iacopo P  to  Everyone:
	on the other hand you can simply check if someone has corrupt your data, cause you could re-hash your original value and verify if it's match with the receive hased value  to perform a double check
20:47:55 From  Wong Ming Yui Lucas  to  Everyone:
	Just curious: why SEC never sue Ethereum Foundation for ICOs
20:48:26 From  Edison Qu  to  Everyone:
	what was the cause of the crypto winter
20:48:32 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	They are preoccupied with Ripple atm
20:48:38 From  Anthony Colas | ToDestiny.eth#7351  to  Everyone:
	JPMorgan came in :p
20:48:39 From  bx pana  to  Everyone:

20:48:48 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	#BUIDL market
20:48:53 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	it's the same crypto winter we're experiencing right now? 😖
20:49:03 From  Sparx | Extropy  to  Everyone:
	Ethereum Foundation is HQ in Zug Swizterland, so out of reach of the SEC
20:49:13 From  Brian Vazquez  to  Everyone:
	2019 was a chill year jajaja
20:49:15 From  Iacopo P  to  Everyone:

20:49:34 From  Duncan Cox  to  Everyone:

	“Elliptic curves have a shorter key length for the same level of security as RSA” 🤯
20:53:40 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Anyone trying to “learn in public,” I’d suggest tweeting things like that
20:54:09 From  Charles Freeborn | charliecodes#8351  to  Everyone:
	Yes - I learn in public @derrek
20:54:09 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	Noted!!!
20:55:28 From  Marian Jiménez-P  to  Everyone:
	Ok, I would like to ask a question to get sure I do understand the abstract picture so that at the moment I code I do know what I am creating: 	I do know that blockchain is formed by blocks that keep X transactions and are closed with a hash that "can not" be desencrypted. 	Now, the hashes tree here, how does it fit?
20:56:22 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	^ I suggest working your way through the demo he just showed on your own time to see how the pieces fit together https://demoblockchain.org/blockchain
20:56:34 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	Merkle Trees are used to hash a collection of hashes, so you only need to store and verify the Top Hash thereby saving space and computation. If one leaf or a node is changed, the Top Hash would change as a result.
20:56:51 From  Rodrigo Iglesias  to  Everyone:
	Not sure if if completely get it but I think merkle trees are just to make transactions tamper proof
20:57:04 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	Thanks for that Yash
20:57:05 From  Ryan R. Fox | Algorand  to  Everyone:
	the next block points to the previous block hash. It's the merkle root of all those transactions. Therefore a chain of blocks attest to the prior transactions.
20:57:10 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	the leafs of the tree are all the transactions that are going to be hashed and coupled together, together, together to  produce a unique hash, hence the block hash
20:57:20 From  Tim Wolters  to  Everyone:
	+1 Yash
20:57:25 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Great answer, Ryan! Now I understand better
20:58:37 From  Gavin | soace#0700  to  Everyone:
	If I have a transaction how can I verify whether it was in a block just given the Merkle tree root hash of the block?
21:00:21 From  NoodleDonn212  to  Everyone:
	jsonRpc
21:00:35 From  Ryan R. Fox | Algorand  to  Everyone:
	you cannot. you must also have the order of the transactions and all the transaction along the path to calculate the mercle rrot and compare
21:01:03 From  Gavin | soace#0700  to  Everyone:
	That makes sense. Thanks Ryan
21:03:58 From  Marissa Curry  to  Everyone:
	is it node
21:04:09 From  Marissa Curry  to  Everyone:
	in the sense of C++ nodes oin linked lists
21:04:51 From  Piære  to  Everyone:
	I encourage anyone to try and run a node, it's great to learn first hand how it works and support the network
21:05:19 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	on which blockchain do u suggest?
21:05:50 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	i just started running a validator using Rocket Pool last week! 😎
21:05:52 From  Iacopo P  to  Everyone:
	@Marissa i don't think so, you can see the blochchain as a linked list. A single node is a "processor" of blockchain
21:05:58 From  CryptoMartian #2869  to  Everyone:
	you may read mastering Bitcoin Book having good example about merkle tree.  Both books mastering Ethereum and Mastering Bitcoin are good source to know more fundamentals. https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/14a25a6fd9e97002c57a46f1fe9faf48cd5d6e46/ch07.asciidoc#merkle-trees
21:06:00 From  Ryan R. Fox | Algorand  to  Everyone:
	"node” is a computer running the consensus protocol and communicating over a peer-to-peer network to exchange transactions and blocks data.
21:06:41 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:

21:06:43 From  Charles Freeborn | charliecodes#8351  to  Everyone:
	@jp angelle did it consume lots of memory on your computer to run the validator?
21:07:27 From  Marian Jiménez-P  to  Everyone:
	oh guys, I do wanna learn from all of you, as I am almost a neophyte programming 😆 (professionally project manager)
21:07:39 From  Wong Ming Yui Lucas  to  Everyone:
	Would a block still be created if no one uses the chain during that period
21:07:58 From  ericbadiere  to  Everyone:
	okay good
21:08:03 From  robodehri#9894  to  Everyone:
	@Wong yes
21:08:04 From  DynòSoar #7340 | Allison  to  Everyone:
	Here with you Mirian. Gonna need support!
21:08:13 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	@charles i bought a dedicated machine. a “NUC" which is essentially a glorified raspberry pi. 32 gbs of RAM and 2 tb storage. more info here: https://twitter.com/gwei_whale/status/1580391529805279232
21:08:21 From  Wong Ming Yui Lucas  to  Everyone:
	Thanks for the ans!

21:08:35 From  DynòSoar #7340 | Allison  to  Everyone:
	😅
21:08:36 From  Edison Qu  to  Everyone:
	what is a genesis block?
21:08:46 From  Iacopo P  to  Everyone:
	the first block produced
21:08:49 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	the first block of the blockchain
21:08:51 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	^
21:08:51 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	first block
21:08:52 From  Edison Qu  to  Everyone:
	ohh okay thank yu
21:09:30 From  Ryan R. Fox | Algorand  to  Everyone:
	@wong yes, on bitcoin, ethereum and _most_ blockchains a block may be produced with an empty transaction set.
21:09:34 From  Charles Freeborn | charliecodes#8351  to  Everyone:
	thanks @JP
21:09:34 From  Latricia Nickelberry-TriciaDev23  to  Everyone:
	@jp angelle I heard about Rocket Pool. Thats cool!
21:11:06 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	@jp angelle i've never heard about this rocket pool, so also with a standard desktop pc (with quite normal components)?
21:12:04 From  robodehri#9894  to  Everyone:
	Rocket pool is for block producers, running full node has nothing to do with rocket pool
21:12:15 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	rocket pool is a decentralized staking pool. ive been followiing the project for a while. super sharp team. somewhat standard. only need like an i5 cpu, but you need a lot of storage. the ethereum storage on chain right now is near 1tb and if you want to future proof it for a few years, you need 2tb
21:12:46 From  NoodleDonn212  to  Everyone:
	How can I access google drive? For notes
21:12:48 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	got it, heavy storage at least
21:12:52 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Shout out for not just running an AWS instance 👏
21:13:14 From  Charles Freeborn | charliecodes#8351  to  Everyone:
	What are the incentives for validating the rocket pool? @jp
21:13:14 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	@jp angelle thanks for the info and the tips
21:13:19 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	😃
21:13:30 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	I’d like to eventually build a machine to run my own node. Sounds like a fun experiment.
21:13:32 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	hahaha hell ya. if AWS goes down, the entire ethereum network will be running out of my house 😆
21:13:41 From  robodehri#9894  to  Everyone:
	@Charles finding block by yourself is hard, when you are part of a pool then you split the block reward basically
21:13:41 From  Piære  to  Everyone:
	there is also dappnode which sells NUC systems already pre-configured to run blockchain nodes
21:13:43 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	💀
21:13:45 From  Latricia Nickelberry-TriciaDev23  to  Everyone:
	😂
21:14:35 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Let’s go Laurence! Proof of Kernel Work 👏👏👏
21:15:05 From  Herb C  to  Everyone:
	confused about the 2 parts of consensus mechanism... what are the 2 parts and can BFT used in conjuction with POS?
21:15:39 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	@charles, you can run a validator with just 16ETH since the protocol pairs with you 16ETH from their liquidity pool. so it lowers the barrier to entry. also, they have software you can use and docs you follow to get you going pretty easy. they also have some tokenomics that make it theoretically more lucrative than solo staking but you would have to be bullish on RPL to buy into that. I'll let you form your own opinion on that
21:17:19 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	"just 16 ETH" 😅💩
21:17:27 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	XD
	
21:17:37 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Guess I’ll go validate Gnosis chain instead 🥲
21:17:49 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	haha i should clarify “just 16 ETH” as compared to 32ETH
21:18:20 From  Charles Freeborn | charliecodes#8351  to  Everyone:
	lol at 16ETH
21:18:37 From  Gavin | soace#0700  to  Everyone:
	I think there are proposals in rocketpool to lower the 16eth requirement even more for what it’s worth
21:18:54 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	yeah i think 4eth and 8eth minipools are on the road map.
21:19:18 From  Marco Giangolini  to  Everyone:
	that could be feasible (maybe 😁)
21:19:27 From  Wong Ming Yui Lucas  to  Everyone:
	Most staked ether r through Lido. Is that a security concern to the system?
21:19:34 From  Gavin | soace#0700  to  Everyone:
	yes
21:19:41 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	yeah, centralized
21:20:02 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	rocketpool is 100% decentralized. so i hope more projects like rocketpool come about.
21:20:05 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	Just like the huge chunk of DAI that’s collateralized by USDC 🥲
21:20:11 From  Anthony Colas | ToDestiny.eth#7351  to  Everyone:
	Security problem is staking proof of stake protocols in a centralized company such as AWS… Just my opinion…
21:20:30 From  Piære  to  Everyone:
	lido validators aren't linked to each other so it’s still better than staking with Binance or coinbase
21:20:38 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	i think Lido plans to decentralize....but dont we all…
21:20:49 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:

21:23:05 From  Esteban Rodriguez  to  Everyone:
	How will teams be assigned?
21:23:10 From  Yash Jagtap  to  Everyone:
	unless you are using chainlink
21:23:15 From  Ihab | Hebx  to  Everyone:
	using chainlink for vrf  and random number generator of the dice
21:23:16 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	If only there was some way to mathematically create the output of the dice roll… like an algorithmically generated random number…
21:23:17 From  Derrek Coleman  to  Everyone:
	an AlgoRand ;)
21:23:28 From  NoodleDonn212  to  Everyone:
	Mapping for balances
21:24:02 From  Kemal Ardıl Gülez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	balances and stuff is much easier to handle
21:24:06 From  Sparx | Extropy  to  Everyone:
	VRF on chainlink or QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator)
21:24:06 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:

21:25:02 From  Sparx | Extropy  to  Everyone:

21:25:05 From  Ihab | Hebx  to  Everyone:
	QRNG 😲
21:25:25 From  Sparx | Extropy  to  Everyone:
	VRF is very expensive on Ethereum mainnet
21:25:38 From  Marissa Curry  to  Everyone:
