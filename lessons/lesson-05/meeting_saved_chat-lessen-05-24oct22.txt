	why metamask says it ignores nonce?
20:16:29 From  jp angelle  to  Everyone:
	metamask sux
20:16:40 From  iouri volkov  to  Everyone:
	lol
20:18:00 From  Simon B.  to  Everyone:
	Why does it mean, ‚Äúmetamask ignores nonce"?
20:18:00 From  Moiz Sajid  to  Everyone:
	Use Tally Ho instead https://tally.cash/
20:18:06 From  Simon B.  to  Everyone:
	What*
20:18:20 From  Shlomi Farkash|Shloyem#1673  to  Everyone:
	There's a "State" tab in Etherscan transactions that makes it easier to see funds movement	https://etherscan.io/tx/0x814e6a21c8eb34b62a05c1d0b14ee932873c62ef3c8575dc49bcf12004714eda#statechange

20:21:36 From  Moiz Sajid  to  Everyone:
	Don't know. I know it supports Ledger though.
20:23:15 From  Tim Wolters  to  Everyone:
	is there any discussion about setting the gas price a transaction would like to hit and once it hits that then it sends the transaction?
20:24:55 From  Paul Len | DefiBro  to  Everyone:
	You can do that in metamask. just set gas price lower and wait.
20:25:14 From  Tim Wolters  to  Everyone:
	cool, didn't know that about metamask
20:25:42 From  Simon B.  to  Everyone:
	If the timeout wouldn't be reached.
20:26:12 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:
	Just dont touch the limit Tim, then you risk the transaction failing
20:26:12 From  Paul Len | DefiBro  to  Everyone:
	You put yourself at greater risk of getting front ran, and because of nonces, you cannot transact on ethereum while you wait
20:26:38 From  Paul Len | DefiBro  to  Everyone:
	and yes there is a timeout too
20:27:11 From  Cameron HR  to  Everyone:
	Just depends what you're trying to do. I almost always set custom gas though‚Ä¶
20:41:10 From  Daniel I√±iguez | danieliniguezv#8256  to  Everyone:
	up until now what memory were we using last week on the contracts we've been writing testing?
20:41:51 From  Kundan Mishra  to  Everyone:
	why do we need location for string parameters but not with uint or int
20:42:26 From  Obaid  to  Everyone:
	Because strings are expensive
20:42:47 From  c114#4508  to  Everyone:
	strings uses pointers
20:43:06 From  Tim Wolters  to  Everyone:
	so memory would be available across calls in a single transaction?
20:43:09 From  Kunal J  to  Everyone:
	you need to specify what type of "storage mechanisms" you need for strings
20:43:52 From  Frances_#6294  to  Everyone:
	stack and heap in OS course
20:44:01 From  Frances_#6294  to  Everyone:
	the memory and calldata reminds me....
20:44:35 From  Juan Isaac  to  Everyone:
	Storage is expensive! Very expensive operation

	which memory have we been using in the contracts that we've been writing and testing?

	It would be nice if we went through the assigned homework the next class day, so we dont get too far behind and make sure we are level set for the next homework assignment.  just imo üôèüèΩ
