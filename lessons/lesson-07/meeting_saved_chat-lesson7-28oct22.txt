20:09:34 From  Kemal Ardƒ±l G√ºlez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	@spazefalcon there is no treasure, you can see your team name by:
20:10:19 From  Kemal Ardƒ±l G√ºlez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	checking the event, clicking on the contract, getting the address of the contract creator, looking for the creator address in the teams list
20:11:00 From  Edward Mercado  to  Everyone:

20:11:17 From  Brian - 0xlobster  to  Everyone:
	Is the register contract a whitelist contract?

20:33:20 From  Eduardo Spiegel  to  Everyone:
	neither
20:33:25 From  Chuck d'Gaf#1337 | @0xdGaf  to  Everyone:
	provably*
20:33:37 From  Kemal Ardƒ±l G√ºlez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	why did the attacker go for Hash(X,bytes,bytes,uint32) and not Hash(X,bytes)?
20:34:06 From  ziad#0420  to  Everyone:
	because the manager contract only calls functions that have parameters bytes,bytes,uint32
20:34:21 From  Gabriel Fior|wisk#9125  to  Everyone:
	is this the equivalent of having a dynamic function call, for ex. in python? e.g. execute('my_nice_method(arg1))?
20:35:24 From  Chuck d'Gaf#1337 | @0xdGaf  to  Everyone:
	More method signature than dynamic function. I would think.
20:35:48 From  "Drew" George Roberson  to  Everyone:
	Money printer go brrr
20:36:25 From  Pato Funes  to  Everyone:
	what's your take on why this happens? poor auditing?
20:36:26 From  Enkhuliral Dechin (enkhmanal)  to  Everyone:
	There is also a youtube explanation
20:36:27 From  Enkhuliral Dechin (enkhmanal)  to  Everyone:

20:36:38 From  Enkhuliral Dechin (enkhmanal)  to  Everyone:
	Have not watched it; just found it on youtube
20:39:12 From  Corey H | WordsPerMinute#3546  to  Everyone:
	when are the values are bytes/bytes/uint64 actually determined? were they always the same so that he was then able to brute force until he got the hash he wanted?
20:39:27 From  Juan Isaac  to  Everyone:
	When contract is compiled
20:39:31 From  Juan Isaac  to  Everyone:
	I think
20:39:55 From  Corey H | WordsPerMinute#3546  to  Everyone:
	okay, thanks
20:40:51 From  ziad#0420  to  Everyone:
	is that by using the .call function on address?
20:43:22 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	whoopsies
20:43:36 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:

	haha
20:44:51 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:
	Dumb question, but is there a specific law that hacking a vulnerable contract is actually illegal?
20:45:07 From  Jamie - lilpizza.eth  to  Everyone:
	wow
20:45:16 From  Enkhuliral Dechin (enkhmanal)  to  Everyone:

20:45:36 From  Pato Funes  to  Everyone:
	depends who you ask to, lol
20:45:42 From  Rodrigo Iglesias - text  to  Everyone:
	I guess it would be like finding a hole in the wall of the bank and stealing the money..
20:46:09 From  Oscar  to  Everyone:
	Or rather financial instruments at the very least
20:46:15 From  icculus.lyx#3787  to  Everyone:
	Yea but stealing from a bank is a specific entity, this is a public contract in the wild
20:47:03 From  Austin Motley  to  Everyone:

	lol
20:47:25 From  Enkhuliral Dechin (enkhmanal)  to  Everyone:
	question is does money which is sitting in contract belong to users or the contract itself.
20:47:51 From  Gabriel Fior|wisk#9125  to  Everyone:
	is this dynamic method selection (from the hashes of method name + param types) also true for other chains, like Solana?
