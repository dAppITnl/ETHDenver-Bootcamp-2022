20:57:14 From  kvutien  to  Everyone:
	Weekend philosophic question: is decentralization an illusion, after all? Some humans have to vote and do the final decision, like the outcome of The DAO hack. Analogous is the G√∂del theorem of uncertainty: a logical environment can't decide about itself.
20:57:24 From  Cameron HR  to  Everyone:
	Anthony, look in your vimrc, you are probably using some already.

20:58:14 From  Kundan Mishra  to  Everyone:

	Thanks! We learn new things every day!
20:59:05 From  Kemal Ardƒ±l G√ºlez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	@kvutien proper decentralization requires a whole lot of people to chime in with sweat equity of their own. a lot more people than the current number. as we see in the real world, given the choice, people will always prefer to just not do jack shit and free ride on whatever improvements are given to them over doing actual work to make the world better
21:00:48 From  ziad#0420  to  Everyone:
	since this seems so streamlined, why isn't there a `hardhat deploy` command?
21:02:09 From  Oscar  to  Everyone:
	Because maybe you want to do stuff before/during/after the deployment so a script allows you do that
21:02:35 From  Chuck d'Gaf#1337 | @0xdGaf  to  Everyone:
	Looks like they borrowed RSpec's DSL
21:09:13 From  Kemal Ardƒ±l G√ºlez | Feather#6011  to  Everyone:
	@ziad deploy what? I mean, even Remix asks you which contract you would like to deploy and what you want to use as constructor args. How is hardhat supposed to know that without asking? What if you want to deploy multiple contracts and use some value from the contract you deploy first as a constructor argument for the second contract?
